In this directory is all the information necessary to perform the three data transformation steps mentioned in methods section 3.3.1.

There are three folders: 
- Parkinson_CJD_RSID: All the code and information necessary to infer SNP RSIDs for the Parkinson and CJD GWAS summary-statistics
- GRCh38_to_GRCh37_LBD: All the code and information necessary to switch the reference genome build of the LBD dataset from GRCh38 to GRCh37. 
- extract_eQTLs: All code and information necessary to extract the cis-eQTLs

IMPORTANT: Every folder has a .docx file going into sufficient detail to be able to do everything. Without reading the .docx file in each folder it will be hard to understand what the code in each ".R" file is supposed to be.
